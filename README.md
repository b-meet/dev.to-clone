I started this project when I just felt basic concepts of react are done and to make something big, So since then I have learnt a lot of new things and I want all those to be part of this project as well. Hence A lot of work in here is under construction or say under renovation ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…. This ain't a final code nor the final file structure.

The middle portion thats the articles are coming from the official [DEV api](https://developers.forem.com/api/#operation/getLatestArticles). On which I haven't implemented the pagination yet.
